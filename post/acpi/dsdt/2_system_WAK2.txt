#
# In 10.8.5 and perhaps later versions of OS X, DSDT method _WAK
# called after resuming from S3 suspend (Sleep, or suspend to RAM),
# is called with garbage in Arg0, where it should be a value 
# representing the sleep state being left (1-5).
#
# This causes problems for code in DSDT _WAK method which expects
# and checks against Arg0==3 for wake from sleep to turn on various
# devices or restore internal state to a working state.
#
# This patch adds code at the very beginning of the method to
# force an an out-of-range Arg0 to 3.
#
# See system_WAK1.txt for an alternate patch
#
# Note regarding Yosemite:
#  At least in Yosemite 10.10.2, this bug appears to be fixed.
#  I didn't notice/verify on other versions of Yosemite
